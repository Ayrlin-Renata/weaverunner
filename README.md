**PLEASE READ FIRST**  
i made this with the intent to reduce the repetitive work for dedicated & veteran Holoearth creators. i don't really want it to become a 'must-have' or a popular software to recommend to new creators - because i hope that dialogue and feedback continues to inspire the developers to enhance the creator experience, and i dont want the utility of a 3rd party application to become a point of criticism among users who are not invested to see the long-term success of the game. also, the precedent of reccommending 3rd party programs equipped with computer vision and keyboard/mouse control is a dangerous norm. please consider carefully before sharing

* DO NOT interact with the mouse or keyboard while the automation is running.
* PRESS ESC to STOP the automation if it begins unintended actions.
